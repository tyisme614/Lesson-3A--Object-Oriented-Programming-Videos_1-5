1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,760
Let's do the first task.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,150
I'm going to change the name of the display method to displayquantity.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,570
Now this causes some errors in our app.

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:14,190
If I scroll up I see an error that says cannot resolve method display int.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,610
This is actually related to the second task,

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,980
where we asked if you need to change the way that the method is called.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,928
The answer is yes, because when we change the name of the method,

8
00:00:22,928 --> 00:00:25,400
we need to change the way that it's called.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,370
So, in the increment method, I'm going to change this to say displayQuantity,

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,340
and then decrement method,

11
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,460
I'm going to change this to say displayQuantity as well.

12
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,420
Now there's no more errors in our app and

13
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,950
I can save this and then run the app on the device.

14
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,140
And the app works as expected.

15
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,550
There's no user visible change, but internally,

16
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:44,555
in our code, we did change the method name.
