1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,760
那么你今天是如何去上班的呢？
So how did you get to work today?

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,190
我有一辆自行车  挺不错的
&gt;&gt; I have a bike, works out just fine.

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:05,280
你呢？
How about you?

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,440
好吧  我开车去的
&gt;&gt; Okay. I drive.

5
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,020
酷！  你的车怎么样？
&gt;&gt; Oh cool, how's that car working out?

6
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:08,600
挺不错的
&gt;&gt; It's good.

7
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,870
是吗  那你知道它是如何工作的吗
&gt;&gt; Yeah? Do you know how it works,

8
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,840
引擎盖下的秘密是什么呢？
underneath the hood?

9
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,090
不  我不需要知道
&gt;&gt; No, I don't need to.

10
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,630
我只需要插入钥匙  然后直接启动就行
I just need to put the key in, and then I drive it.

11
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,040
你知道  这就好像写代码一样
You know, this is kind of like writing code.

12
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,860
哪些方面像呢？
&gt;&gt; In what way?

13
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,220
嗯。。。  其实都很像写代码
&gt;&gt; Well, everything is kind of like writing code.

14
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,330
对的  别走神  听我好好解释
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah. &gt;&gt; Stick with me for a second.

15
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,740
在之前的课程里  我们给学生们一大堆代码
In previous lessons we gave students a bunch of code.

16
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,670
我们为他们提供了一些调用方法  比如显示方法
&gt;&gt; Yeah. We gave them methods like the display

17
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,160
显示价格方法
method and the display price method.

18
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,940
对的  而且我们一直在说
&gt;&gt; Right. And we kept saying,

19
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,200
别担心这个
well, don't worry about this.

20
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,720
我们以后会详细解释它们的功能
We'll talk about what it does later.

21
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,290
所谓的"以后"就是现在
Well that later is now.

22
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,120
好吧好吧
&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay.

23
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,520
正如你知道汽车是如何工作的一样
So much like you know how a car works.

24
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,560
你可以使用这些方法
You can use it.

25
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,510
学生们可以利用这些方法
Students were able to use that method.

26
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,035
是吗？
&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Right?

27
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:41,845
但是我们设计了这个方法  所以这里
But we wrote the method, so we were

28
00:00:41,845 --> 00:00:43,800
我们就相当于汽车的设计师  我明白了
the designers of the car in that case. &gt;&gt; I see.

29
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,380
所以主题思想就是你可以在其他地方定义方法
So the main idea is that you can define the method somewhere.

30
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,090
就好像造车一样
&gt;&gt; So that's like building the car.

31
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,590
然后在后面你可以调用那个方法
&gt;&gt; And then later you can call that method.

32
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,100
相当于开车
&gt;&gt; That's like driving the car.

33
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,860
对
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

34
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,200
后面我们还要用到这个思想
&gt;&gt; So let's use those ideas next.

35
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,500
听起来不错
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.

36
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,506
在MainActivity.java文件里
&gt;&gt; Within the MainActivity.java file,

37
00:00:56,506 --> 00:00:59,540
display 方法就在这定义
this is where the display method is defined.

38
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,956
这里是它被调用的地方  在increment方法里
And this is where it's getting called, within the increment method and

39
00:01:02,956 --> 00:01:04,769
和decrement方法
within the decrement method.

40
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,640
display方法的实现体接受一个数字的参数
The instructions of the display method take in a number and

41
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,550
然后在屏幕显示
then display it on the screen.

42
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:11,730
就像这里一样
Like this right here.

43
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:16,360
我们可以将它的实现体拷贝到调用该方法的地方
Instead of defining a method we can also just take the instructions inside of it

44
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,300
而不是重新定义一个新的方法
by copying it and then pasting it where we called that method.

45
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,580
由于数字在这里不是变量  我们将仅仅改变它的数量
And since number is not a variable here, we're going to change it to quantity.

46
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,550
如果我们想要实现increment方法
If we want to do the same for

47
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,940
一样的功能  可以将代码拷贝到这里
the increment method, we'd copy this code and then paste it up here.

48
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,740
这段代码和我们之前那段的功能一样
So this code works the same as we had before, but

49
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,950
现在我们不需要display方法
now we don't need the display method.

50
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,060
不过这样的实现方法的弊端是我们在两个方法里出现了
The disadvantage to this implementation is that we have duplicate code

51
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,150
冗余的代码
in both methods.

52
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:46,170
相反  如果我们定义display方法  然后以这个名字调用它
Instead, if we define the display method and then we just call it by its name,

53
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,500
然后我们就可以精简代码  这对程序是好的
then we can have less code which is better for the app.

54
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,670
我还要给大家展示一下其它很酷的东西
I also want to show you something else that's cool.

55
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,540
每当你看到一个方法  你可以点一下然后再右键点一下
Anytime you see a method, you can click on it and then right click.

56
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:00,610
然后转向"声明"  如果用的是Mac  可以使用Command + V快捷键
And then go to declaration, or Command + V if you're on a Mac.

57
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,100
这样会转向我们定义函数方法的地方
This scrolls the file to where the method is defined.

58
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,650
这个很有用  通过它你可以看到函数方法的
This is useful because then you can see the actual instructions that

59
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,490
实现体
are contained within that method.

60
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,300
对于其它方法
For other methods,

61
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,480
它会打开Android框架代码
it may open up a declaration in the Android framework code.

62
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,940
这些是Android团队写的  比如TextView.java文件
This was written by the Android team, the TextView.java file.

63
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,200
虽然这看起来十分神奇
This shows that, even though things may look like magic,

64
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,150
你可以随时转向该函数方法的代码实现
you can always trace it back to the lines of code where it was defined.

65
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,970
不管是你还是Android团队
Either by you or by someone on the Android team.

66
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,150
为了帮助大家理解方法定义和方法调用之间的区别
To help you understand the difference between defining versus calling

67
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,930
我们来改改MainActivity
a method, let's modify the main activity.

68
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,960
这里我们要改变函数方法定义的方法  将方法的名字从display
We're going to change the way a method is defined by changing the name of

69
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,585
改为displayQuantity
the display method to the name displayQuantity.

70
00:02:42,585 --> 00:02:47,450
对于函数方法的调用  我们需要改变那些代码呢？
Then for calling this method, do we need to change anything about that code?

71
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:51,710
如果这些改变造成了程序的错误  确保能够定位到错误
If these changes cause an error in your app, make sure to address that so

72
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,770
然后再在设备上重新运行一遍
that you can run the app on your phone again.

73
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:53,775
完成后在方格里打勾
Check these boxes when you're done.
