1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,270
正确答案就是选项C
The correct answer to this quiz is option C.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,480
如果你找不到答案也没什么
It's okay if you didn't get the answer,

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,810
因为有可能这里所包含的内容是我们之前没有学到的
though, because it was covering topics that we haven't learned about yet.

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:12,590
我会在更高的角度为大家解释为什么这个选项是对的或者错的
At a high level I will quickly go through why each option was correct or

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:17,530
而且在接下来的视频里我们会学习到更多的相关内容
incorrect, but we'll learn more about all these terms in the following videos.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,420
我们先来看看这里的是那个选项  找找他们的不同
Let's look at our three options here and look for differences between them.

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,190
首先  大家可能注意到了每个方法的里的这个代码
First, you may have noticed that the lines of code inside each method

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,420
是一样的
are the same.

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,020
这里  这里  和这里
Right here, right here, and right here.

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,400
而且代码上面的注释也是一样的
Also the comment above each method is also the same.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,500
这段注释用来描述该方法的功能
And the comment is just what describes what the method does.

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,380
这个方法用于根据订单量计算
And the method is supposed to calculate the price of the order

13
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,030
订单的价格
based on the quantity.

14
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:44,150
另外一个类似的地方在于他们都以private这个词打头
Another similarity is that they all start with the word private.

15
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,790
现在我们还不清楚它的意义  不过这没关系
We don't know what that means yet, but that's okay.

16
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,740
下一个词是这个int
The next word here is int.

17
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:55,410
虽然在选项B里没有int  但是在选项C里有int
It doesn't say int though in Option B, but it does say int in option C.

18
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,770
所以由于某些原因  这里有些不同
So, for some reason, it's different here.

19
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,260
我们再看下一个部分
Let's move onto the next part.

20
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,250
这里的calculate  price是两个独立的单词
Here it says calculate price and it's two words.

21
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,990
在选项B里  CalculatePrice以驼峰命名法被结合为一个单词
In Option B, CalculatePrice is smushed together as a single word in camel case.

22
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,690
在选项C中也以驼峰命名法结合为一个单词
In option C it's also in camel case, with no spaces.

23
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:17,530
继续往下我们看到左圆括号和里面的int型数量
Then moving along we see an opening parenthesis and then int quantity.

24
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,420
但是没有右圆括号  这看上去有点奇怪
There's no closing parenthesis though, which is a little weird.

25
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,130
在选项B中  我们可以看到一对圆括号和int型数量
In Option B, we also see opening and closing parentheses and int quantity.

26
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,010
在选项C里  我们同样可以看到一对圆形括号和int型数量
In option C, we see opening closing parentheses, and int quantity.

27
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,690
然后我们看到这里有一对大括号
Then, we see there's an opening brace here, and a closing brace.

28
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,960
但是选项B里没有
But not in option B.

29
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,610
然后在选项C里也有一对大括号
And they do show up in option C, though.

30
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,000
然后我们可以注意到在不同选项的代码里的不同点
So we notice a bunch of differences among the different options.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,550
我们通过Google搜索来看一下什么才是正确的
Let's look at an example of what a valid method should be

32
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,520
方法定义
by doing a Google search.

33
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,350
我打开浏览器搜索“定义Java方法”
So I'm going to open up a browser and then search for define java method.

34
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,770
你也可以用别的关键词搜索
You could have searched for a different query and

35
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,880
也能找到对应的答案
that would have worked as well.

36
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,040
第一个链接看上去不错
This first link looks good.

37
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,720
来自Oracle官方的Java文档
It's from the official Oracle documentation on Java.

38
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,740
点击一下
I'm going to click on it.

39
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,020
如果你之前没看过这个页面  可以暂停视频
If you haven't seen this page before, feel free to pause the video now and

40
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,669
然后点指导纲上的内容了解一下
click on the link in the instructor notes to skim through this page.

41
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:12,850
虽然这个和我们的代码并不完全一致
While this doesn't match our code exactly, you could try to pattern

42
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:17,090
大家可以对照着比较一下我们代码的方法声明
match the components of this method declaration with our code.

43
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,750
这里这句话很有用
This other sentence here is helpful.

44
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,660
它说方法声明的必要部分包括方法返回类型
It talks about how the required elements of a method declaration are the method's

45
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:28,930
方法名称  圆括号和大括号包含的实现体
return type, name, a pair of parenthesis and a body between these braces.

46
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,340
我提到了好多新的词汇  大家可以阅读一下下面的内容
Now, I just mentioned a lot of new words and you can read about them below.

47
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,880
在后面我们会详细介绍更多细节
But, we'll talk about them in more detail later.

48
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:41,150
我们现在来通过这些信息帮助我们解剖我们这里的选项
Let's try to use this information here to help us narrow down our options.

49
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,210
如果我们用这里的选项和文档页面里正确的代码声明进行对比
If we compare this option with the proper method declaration

50
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:48,460
这里的这个选项就是不正确的
on the documentation page, this option is actually incorrect.

51
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,670
这里只有左括号没有右括号
There is an opening parentheses here but there's no closing parentheses.

52
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,825
文档里说我们需要一对圆括号
And in the documentation, it says that we need a complete pair of parentheses,

53
00:02:56,825 --> 00:02:59,670
像这里和这里
like right here and right here.

54
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,920
文档里也提到了方法的命名需要和
The documentation also says that a method name has to follow the same rules

55
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,380
对象或者变量的命名方式一致
as the naming for a field or variables, and

56
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:14,080
也就是我们这里用到的驼峰命名法  里面不包含空格
that means we need to use camel case and not have any spaces in the name.

57
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,670
那么选项A是不对的  我们看看选项B  这里我们缺少了大括号
So it's not option A, let's go on to option B, here we're missing the opening

58
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:24,030
文件里明确说了需要一对大括号
and closing braces, which the documentation said were required.

59
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,370
选项B没有返回值类型
Option B is also missing the method's return type

60
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,420
而正确的声明方法应该在方法名前有返回类型
which is suppose to come before the method name.

61
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,520
所以这里我们应该有一个int类型
So right here we should have the word int,

62
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,560
因为我们需要这个方法返回价格
because we want to return the price as the output of this method.

63
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,950
选项B不正确有两个原因
So Option B is also incorrect for two reason.

64
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,380
所以希望选项C能好点
So let's hope that Option C is better.

65
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,420
这里我们有一个返回类型
Here we have a return data type which is correct, and

66
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,570
然后我们以驼峰命名法命名方法名称
then we have a method name that is correctly spelled in CamelCase.

67
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,200
而且还有一对圆括号  而且也有
We also have an opening and closing parenthesis, as well as an opening and

68
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,370
一对大括号
closing braces.

69
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,300
这个看上去不错
So this one looks really good.

70
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,480
选项C包含所有方法声明需要的部分
Option C has all the required parts of a method.

71
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:58,485
接下来我们再深入讲解一下
Let's talk more about this next.
