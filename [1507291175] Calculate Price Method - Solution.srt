1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,270
The correct answer to this quiz is option C.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,480
It's okay if you didn't get the answer,

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,810
though, because it was covering topics that we haven't learned about yet.

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:12,590
At a high level I will quickly go through why each option was correct or

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:17,530
incorrect, but we'll learn more about all these terms in the following videos.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,420
Let's look at our three options here and look for differences between them.

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,190
First, you may have noticed that the lines of code inside each method

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,420
are the same.

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,020
Right here, right here, and right here.

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,400
Also the comment above each method is also the same.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,500
And the comment is just what describes what the method does.

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,380
And the method is supposed to calculate the price of the order

13
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,030
based on the quantity.

14
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:44,150
Another similarity is that they all start with the word private.

15
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,790
We don't know what that means yet, but that's okay.

16
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,740
The next word here is int.

17
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:55,410
It doesn't say int though in Option B, but it does say int in option C.

18
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,770
So, for some reason, it's different here.

19
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,260
Let's move onto the next part.

20
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,250
Here it says calculate price and it's two words.

21
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,990
In Option B, CalculatePrice is smushed together as a single word in camel case.

22
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,690
In option C it's also in camel case, with no spaces.

23
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:17,530
Then moving along we see an opening parenthesis and then int quantity.

24
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,420
There's no closing parenthesis though, which is a little weird.

25
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,130
In Option B, we also see opening and closing parentheses and int quantity.

26
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,010
In option C, we see opening closing parentheses, and int quantity.

27
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,690
Then, we see there's an opening brace here, and a closing brace.

28
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,960
But not in option B.

29
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,610
And they do show up in option C, though.

30
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,000
So we notice a bunch of differences among the different options.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,550
Let's look at an example of what a valid method should be

32
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,520
by doing a Google search.

33
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,350
So I'm going to open up a browser and then search for define java method.

34
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,770
You could have searched for a different query and

35
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,880
that would have worked as well.

36
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,040
This first link looks good.

37
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,720
It's from the official Oracle documentation on Java.

38
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,740
I'm going to click on it.

39
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,020
If you haven't seen this page before, feel free to pause the video now and

40
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,669
click on the link in the instructor notes to skim through this page.

41
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:12,850
While this doesn't match our code exactly, you could try to pattern

42
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:17,090
match the components of this method declaration with our code.

43
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,750
This other sentence here is helpful.

44
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,660
It talks about how the required elements of a method declaration are the method's

45
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:28,930
return type, name, a pair of parenthesis and a body between these braces.

46
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,340
Now, I just mentioned a lot of new words and you can read about them below.

47
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,880
But, we'll talk about them in more detail later.

48
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:41,150
Let's try to use this information here to help us narrow down our options.

49
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,210
If we compare this option with the proper method declaration

50
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:48,460
on the documentation page, this option is actually incorrect.

51
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,670
There is an opening parentheses here but there's no closing parentheses.

52
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,825
And in the documentation, it says that we need a complete pair of parentheses,

53
00:02:56,825 --> 00:02:59,670
like right here and right here.

54
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,920
The documentation also says that a method name has to follow the same rules

55
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,380
as the naming for a field or variables, and

56
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:14,080
that means we need to use camel case and not have any spaces in the name.

57
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,670
So it's not option A, let's go on to option B, here we're missing the opening

58
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:24,030
and closing braces, which the documentation said were required.

59
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,370
Option B is also missing the method's return type

60
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,420
which is suppose to come before the method name.

61
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,520
So right here we should have the word int,

62
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,560
because we want to return the price as the output of this method.

63
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,950
So Option B is also incorrect for two reason.

64
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,380
So let's hope that Option C is better.

65
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,420
Here we have a return data type which is correct, and

66
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,570
then we have a method name that is correctly spelled in CamelCase.

67
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,200
We also have an opening and closing parenthesis, as well as an opening and

68
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,370
closing braces.

69
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,300
So this one looks really good.

70
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,480
Option C has all the required parts of a method.

71
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:58,485
Let's talk more about this next.
